Now, like a child raised in the wilderness by wolves, he must learn how to be human... and at the same time, teach his new friends how to think like a Martian. He discovers the joys of sex and free love (which is part of what made this book so popular with the '60s generation) and tries to reconcile the many conflicting teachings of Earthly religions with his Martian knowledge. The reader not only watches Smith's growth, but also gets a tour of a futuristic Earth and all the foibles of human society."

An outside force plants the seeds of real intelligence by way of a great black \"monolith.\"  These first conceptual thoughts launch us towards a chain of events into the future. As the future unfolds, our curiosity leads to the discovery of another such box on the moon--proof positive that we are not the only intelligent force in the universe!  It is a discovery that is as impossible for us to understand as our survival problem was millennia ago. Still, humanity presses on, only to discover another box near Jupiter, which brings even more events crucial to humanity. In 3001: The Final Odyssey, many of the questions are--for good or ill--finally answered.",
