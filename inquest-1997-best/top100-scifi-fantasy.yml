Although Downbelow Station has always prided itself on its neutrality, it's now caught between Earth, Union and merchanter forces, fated to become the center of the conflict."

Now, like a child raised in the wilderness by wolves, he must learn how to be human... and at the same time, teach his new friends how to think like a Martian.  He discovers the joys of sex and free love (which is part of what made this book so popular with the '60s generation) and tries to reconcile the many conflicting teachings of Earthly religions with his Martian knowledge.

His hometown, the underground city of Menzoberranzan, is a rough place, and his family achieved its position of power by adhering to the city's golden rule: Don't get caught.  As Drizzt comes of age, more and more of life in Menzoberranzan becomes repugnant to him, and he can't perform the evil acts his society requires.  Eventually, he embarrasses his family, and, being a male in a matriarchal society, the penalty for that sort of thing is death.  He has no choice but to escape to the surface world, which doesn't take kindly to dark elves, who have a reputation of being bloodthirsty evildoers.  Drizzt's quest for acceptance in \"good\" society and escape from his past lead to many more adventures and battles."

It begins with the establishment of a connection between our ape-ancestors, struggling to merely survive.  We are hopelessly outnumbered by the other animals of the planet.  An outside force plants the seeds of real intelligence by way of a great black \"monolith.\"  These first conceptual thoughts launch us towards a chain of events into the future.  As the future unfolds, our curiosity leads to the discovery of another such box on the moon--proof positive that we are not the only intelligent force in the universe!  It is a discovery that is as impossible for us to understand as our survival problem was millennia ago.  Still, humanity presses on, only to discover another box near Jupiter, which brings even more events crucial to humanity.  In 3001: The Final Odyssey, many of the questions are--for good or ill--finally answered."
