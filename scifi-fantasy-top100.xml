    <inquest>Humanity has been exploring space for a few hundred years with sub-light ships, long enough to establish trade routes between orbital stations in a handful of distant solar systems.  Downbelow Station is at the crux of the shipping routes, the gateway to Earth's defensive perimeter.  Earth authorities worry that the sub-light communication lags--of 10 years or more in some cases--are giving their distant colonies and upstart merchant vessels too much freedum, but when earth finally cracks down, it's already too late: Scientists at distant Cyteen have already built the first faster-than-light spacedrive, and Cyteen has become the center of a new power called Union.  Although Downbelow Station has always prided itself on its neutrality, it's now caught between Earth, Union and merchanter forces, fated to become the center of the conflict.</inquest>

    <inquest>The Stranger is Valentine Michael Smith, and the Strange Land is Earth.  Smith was born on Mars, the only human survivor of our first expedition there.  He was raised by Martians, then "rescued" by the second expedition some 25 years later.  He thinks of himself as a Martian and uses Martian abilities like levitation without seeing anything unusual about them.  Now, like a child raised in the wilderness by wolves, he must learn how to be human... and at the same time, teach his new friends how to think like a Martian.  He discovers the joys of sex and free love (which is part of what made this book so popular with the '60s generation) and tries to reconcile the many conflicting teachings of Earthly religions with his Martian knowledge.  The reader not only watches Smith's growth, but also gets a tour of a futuristic Earth and all the foibles of human society.</inquest>

    <inquest>One of the best series of gaming related fiction introduces Drizzt Do'Urdern, a dark elf (or Drow) born with something no other has or can afford to have: a conscience.  His hometown, the underground city of Menzoberranzan, is a rough place, and his family achieved its position of power by adhering to the city's golden rule: Don't get caught.  As Drizzt comes of age, more and more of life in Menzoberranzan becomes repugnant to him, and he can't perform the evil acts his society requires.  Eventually, he embarrasses his family, and, being a male in a matriarchal society, the penalty for that sort of thing is death.  He has no choice but to escape to the surface world, which doesn't take kindly to dark elves, who have a reputation of being bloodthirsty evildoers.  Drizzt's quest for acceptance in "good" society and escape from his past lead to many more adventures and battles.</inquest>

    <inquest>How did we get to be what we are?  This series answers that one fundamentally human question.  It begins with the establishment of a connection between our ape-ancestors, struggling to merely survive.  We are hopelessly outnumbered by the other animals of the planet.  An outside force plants the seeds of real intelligence by way of a great black "monolith."  These first conceptual thoughts launch us towards a chain of events into the future.  As the future unfolds, our curiosity leads to the discovery of another such box on the moon--proof positive that we are not the only intelligent force in the universe!  It is a discovery that is as impossible for us to understand as our survival problem was millennia ago.  Still, humanity presses on, only to discover another box near Jupiter, which brings even more events crucial to humanity.  In 3001: The Final Odyssey, many of the questions are--for good or ill--finally answered.</inquest>

Mindkiller (the first novella in Deathkiller) traces the paths of two men as mysteries in their lives irrevocably draw them to converge on one enigmatic organization--a corporation that is responsible for creating technology that lets people die from pure pleasure.  It also has the first permanent means of brainwashing a person.  The protagonists decide to try to shut down this cartel, even though they know it will certainly mean their doom.  This book reads like a mystery-thriller the first time thruogh, and offers rich characterization on a second reading, and underneath it all, it asks: What makes life worth living?</inquest>

    <inquest>A monumental tale of a galactic empire spiraling into decline and the secret society of scientists maneuvering to control the damage.  The story begins on the capital planet of an empire that has stood for millenia.  And just one person, mathematics professor Hari Seldon, knows what's going to happen.  Seldon has discovered a new science--psychohistory--that allows him to predict and control the future.  Psychohistory proves that the fall of the empire can't be stopped, but actions can be taken to shorten the coming gloom and lay the foundation for a Second Empire.  Gripping throughout, it doesn't rely on violence to further the plot for as the character Salvor Hardin says, "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."</inquest>
